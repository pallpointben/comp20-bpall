My work in Comp 20- Web Development at Tufts, Fall 2015

This repository is a showcase of some of the work I completed in my web development class at Tufts. In this class, I learned the following, and more:

* HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and the interplay between the three.
* Responsive web design.
* Asynchronously displayed content.
* Separation of server- and client-side concerns.
